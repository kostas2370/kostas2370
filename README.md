I am Konstantinos Damianos, a computer science student from Greece. Programming is my passion and I specialize in using Python-Django and C#, but I am also able to adapt to other languages. My projects include Clippy, an automation video bot using FFmpeg and Twitch API, a cooking website, an eye clinic management system and many more. Check out my GitHub profile to see my work in action.
